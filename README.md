# team-profile-generator
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and gnereates an HTML page that displas summaries for each person.<br>

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input, 
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information,
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input. <br>

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML, THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. WHEN I click on the GitHub username, THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.<br>

WHEN I start the application,THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.<br>

WHEN I select the engineer option, THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.<br>

WHEN I select the intern option, THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.<br>

WHEN I decide to finish building my team, THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
